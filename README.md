# Lost Ships Replacement Enabler

In X4: Foundations, the `Lost Ships Replacement` feature was introduced in version `7.50`. This feature allows the fleet to request a replacement ship if the ship was lost during the execution of the order. The replacement ship will be requested automatically, and the fleet will continue to execute the order.
However, even if you enable the `Lost Ships Replacement` feature for a fleet, the replacement ship will not be requested during the execution of the "default" orders. The replacement ship will only be requested after restarting the order.
This extension fixes this issue for some of them:

- Patrol
- Police
- Protect Position
- Protect Ship
- Protect Station

## Compatibility

This extension is compatible with the following versions:

- X4: Foundations version `7.50`

## Usage

Simple install the extension and use the orders as usual.
One recommendation - better to restart the orders before the enabling the `Lost Ships Replacement` feature.
